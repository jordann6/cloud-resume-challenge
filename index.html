          <h3>Profile</h3>
          <p>
            I transitioned into technology through hands on experience,
            beginning in help desk and progressing into a Software Engineer I
            role by steadily expanding my development and automation
            responsibilities. After leaving law school, I redirected my focus
            toward software engineering and cloud infrastructure, treating
            learning as a deliberate and continuous practice. My work emphasizes
            reliability, reproducibility, and operational awareness across the
            software development lifecycle, with a strong focus on cloud native
            systems and DevOps aligned workflows.
