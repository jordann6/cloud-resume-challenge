          <h3>Profile</h3>
          <p>
            After reading about Forrest Brazeal's Cloud Resume Challenge, I took
            it upon myself to attempt it and document my continuous learning in
            Cloud Computing, coding languages, and various tech stacks. I will
            continue to update this portfolio as I go through this journey.
